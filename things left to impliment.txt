make password be raplaced with *

make the grid show where all of the placed ships are 

fix when inputting the oriantatioin, it works correctly when not entering h or v

CHANGE playerCoordinatesConfigured BACK TO FALSE. 
this is so i can access case 3 without inputting the coordinates for the ships





first get all of the coordinates for the opponents ships, get the gameid and the player playing 
then check each one if it matches with the playerAttack
if it matches then add it to the dbo.attacks with hit as true
else add it to dbo.attacks with hit as false






playerattackfunction display the shit in the first line
